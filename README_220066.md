The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that describes the functions of a networking or telecommunication system. It consists of seven layers that define how data is transmitted over a network.

Here are the seven layers of the OSI model:

Physical Layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting raw bits over a physical medium such as copper wire, fiber-optic cable, or wireless signals.

Data Link Layer: This layer provides error-free transfer of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer. It also handles flow control and access to the physical layer.

Network Layer: This layer manages the logical addressing and routing of data packets between different networks. It also handles congestion control and quality of service (QoS) management.

Transport Layer: This layer ensures reliable delivery of data between end systems, providing error detection and correction, flow control, and congestion avoidance.

Session Layer: This layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications running on different devices. It also provides synchronization and recovery from errors.

Presentation Layer: This layer formats the data to be presented to the application layer. It also handles data compression, encryption, and decryption.

Application Layer: This layer provides services to end-user applications, such as file transfer, email, and web browsing. It interacts with the operating system and communicates with the other layers of the OSI model to facilitate communication between applications on different devices.
